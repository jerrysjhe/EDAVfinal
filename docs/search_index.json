Many students have played games on a PC platform Steam, including us. There are some video games on Steam now and many of them have really great quality. However, it’s always difficult to find good ones in such a large number of games just through the brief game introduction on Steam. So many people will choose to buy and play the games from well-known and developers with adequate funds as these games are more likely to be great. These games are what we call AAA games. It’s obvious that not all AAA games are excellent and not all Non-AAA games are boring. We can’t simply use the “good” or “popular” to determine the difference between AAA games and Non-AAA. Thus, in the project, we would like to find what makes AAA games different from the other games. We are going to present this topic from three parts, evaluation from players, game mode(focus on single-player only and multi-player only games) and game type. Our team has great passion for video games and we spend lots of time on them. We are all interested in finding trends and patterns behind the popular games. Moreover, we would gain insights into what makes a game more successful in terms of sales, play-time and ratings, etc. We want to take a closer look at the data behind the games. But first, let us introduce some backgrounds for our data visualization. 1.1 Brief introduction of Steam Steam is the major gaming platform developed by Valve in PC which almost include all possible games on the PC. It was first launched as gaming improvement software in 2003 as a way for Valve to provide automatic updates for their games, and expanded to include games from third-party publishers. Steam has also expanded into an online web-based and mobile digital storefront. Steam offers digital rights management for protecting game copyrights, matchmaking servers for online multiplayer gaming, video streaming for recording and publishing game videos, and social networking services for connecting and exploring game social. It also provides the user with installation and automatic updating of games, and community features such as friends lists and groups, cloud saving, and in-game voice and chat functionality. For more detail information, please visit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(service) 1.2 Criteria for judging a game We will use the definition of AAA games: It is a classification used for video games produced and distributed by major famous publisher, typically having higher development and marketing budgets. AAA is analogous to the film industry term “blockbuster”. As there is no generally accepted major famous game company list, we pick the companies which have the highest total sales on steam as our AAA companies (top 0.5% in our project). And games of them are AAA games. For more detail information, please visit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAA_(video_game_industry) 1.3 Question Which companies are major and famous? What games do they have? Is there any pattern between the evaluation of AAA games? For example, the relationship between positive rates and average playtime. Is there any difference of evaluation between AAA and Non-AAA games? What kind of game modes AAA companies prefer, single-player or multi-player? What about the other companies? Will the game modes influence the sales or positive rates? What type of game do the developers prefer to make? What is the difference of the game tags between AAA and Non-AAA games Finally, we have our overall objective: the elements make AAA different from the other games. "],
["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Obstacles 2.2 Plan", " Chapter 2 Data sources The data source is: https://nik-davis.github.io/posts/2019/steam-data-collection/ Since the data above is already scratched from steam and cleaned to a sorted table, we download and read the csv file directly and then do the data cleaning once again based on our request for future use. First, the data is composed of a variety of information for each game on the Steam store. We make use of several columns such as average playtime and positive ratings which we can eventually turn into features for analysis, and we use price and owners columns to possibly inform the success and sales of each game. The owners column of the SteamSpy data could be useful for analyzing specifically. However, the name format for each company is slightly different that may not be accurate enough for doing general analysis. In the process of cleaning, we should integrate the name standard for all the company in dataset. There is also a tags column which appears to crossover with the categories and genres columns in the Steam data. We would like to merge these, or keep one over the other. 2.1 Obstacles There are too many tags for each game, many tags are too specified that is difficult to classify. The sales of a game in dataset only provide ranges (categories) with no specific numbers. The name format for each company is slightly different that may not be accurate enough for doing general analysis. 2.2 Plan Pick the tags with high frequency, and delete the other tags. We should integrate the name standard for all the company in dataset. Look for the raw data and try to get the specific sales, if not, we will use other methods to solve the issue. "],
["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Description 3.2 Data Overview 3.3 Transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Description Since the data has been pre-cleaned by the source, our transformation is: To deal with the sales variable, we convert the ranges (categories) into quantity by generating random numbers from the normal distribution in range. For each range, we set the medium number as the mean, standard deviation as the range/6. The main purpose of generating random number is to produce continuous data instead of categories data. For example, in range “0-20000”, we will replace value by generating number within mean = 10000, and standard deviation = 20000/6 (Since by the definition of area in normal distribution, 20000/6 will cover 99.7% of the total area in normal distribution) if the generated data is outside of 99.7% area in normal distribution, we will round them inside. Combine developers with their branch (For instance, “Ubisoft Montreal” is the Canandian branch of “Ubisoft”) and integrate the format of the same developer in different expressions (For instance, “Astrofish Games” and “Astrofish Games Ltd” or “Astrofish Games Co, Ltd”). Group the data by platform, developer, etc. Filter the developers with the number of games they publish. 3.2 Data Overview First, we look at the graph as dimension of sales number and number of games, from the graph above to find the pattern for games’ sales volume. We draw two vertical lines, sales volume of 10,000 and 100,000, as threshold to identify the game. We can see that it’s approximately a right-skewed normal distribution. The largest bar is around 10,000, which means most games have 10,000 sales volume or below. It means that most of the games on Steam hardly have players to play and are in poor quality. We believe that many games in this range are not produced seriously. The games with more than 100,000 sales volume can be considered relatively popular as we see in the graph. They seem to attract a lot of people and can be compared with AAA games. 3.3 Transformation To make our analysis more reasonable and clear, we filtered out the total game sales of companies that less than 100,000, narrowing down our analyze range. As we said it before, we need good games to compare with AAA games. Using data of games in poor quality will only add the outliers and make the graph unclear. There is no comparability between them. To filter out these games, we compute the total sales volume of companies first. If a company has a high total sales, it’s more likely that the company puts many resources in games and it guarantees the quality of games. Thus, we use the total sales volume of a company when doing filtering. Concerning that sales of games would vary dramatically from the time they just have been released and become steady after a period of time, we drop the games released after 2019 since the result would be unstable. In another perspective of filtering, we mark the companies whose sales volume over 100,000 as “large companies”. We define “ratio” as positive ratings over all ratings and “money” as sales volume multiplied by price. The same distribution is shown after filtering: a right-skewed normal distribution. We can see that most of the games having sales volume less than 10,000 are filtered. "],

["find-aaa-games.html", "Chapter 5 Find AAA Games 5.1 Find AAA Developers 5.2 Overview of AAA Devolpers 5.3 Games of AAA Companies", " Chapter 5 Find AAA Games 5.1 Find AAA Developers First, we try to find AAA developers. We draw the Cleveland dot plots of their sales volume and sales. We draw vertical lines of top 1% and top 0.5% for sales volume and sales. We don’t show smaller companies on the plot. We pick the top 0.5% companies in both graph as our AAA companies. There are 18 companies in total which is an appropriate number considering we want the major companies. 5.2 Overview of AAA Devolpers 5.2.1 Number of Games We reorder the developers by sales and show how many games they released. We are surprised that Pubg Corporation tops the sales but only has one game released. 5.2.2 Sales Volume In the sales plot of AAA companies, Valve surpasses Pubg. We claim that it’s because Valve has more low-price games or free games. We can examine it later by showing their free games. 5.2.3 Total Sales We can see that the Pubg exceeds Valve in sales value. Pubg Corporation with just one game got much more money than all the other companies. Pubg is so popular! 5.3 Games of AAA Companies In this shiny app, users can select and view the data themselves. Choosing the AAA developer and variable, it draws a dot plot of the certain variable of certain developer. The available variables are: “Average playtime”, “Median playtime”, “Ratio”, “Sales Volume”, “Price” and “Sales”. We can have an overview of the games of AAA developers and their performance. If you are a Steam player, you can see many familiar names on it, such as Fallout, The Elder Scrolls, Portals. Feel free to find the games you like and see their performance. "],
["evaluation-from-players.html", "Chapter 6 Evaluation From Players 6.1 Parallel Coordinates 6.2 Correlation of Different Variable 6.3 Relationship of AAA and non-AAA", " Chapter 6 Evaluation From Players In this part, we focus on the evaluation of games. There exist many standards to evaluate games. Here we use positive rates ratio, average playtime and sales as the standard of the games evaluation. And we also put the price of games into our analysis to see the price strategy of game companies. For these three evaluation criteria, ratio is the most convincing one as it represents the impression of players. It directly shows the mainstream opinion toward the games. The average playtime not only depends on the quality of games, but also depends on the type of games. Sales will be influenced by the reputation of the companies and the advertisement of the games. Price is a kind of evaluation, too. It shows the resources put in it and it represents the evaluation from the companies in some way. 6.1 Parallel Coordinates After the brief look and filtering, we draw the parallel coordinates to see the relationship between different game factors. With the interactivity, we can find some intuitive trends: Valve and Ubisoft have many free games, which corresponds to our claim above. Majority of game with low price have a large ratio of good ratings Almost all the games have large ratio, which accord with the claim that AAA games have large ratings High ratios will also have relatively high average playtime 6.2 Correlation of Different Variable We want to see the relationships among the variables of all AAA games. In the shiny app above, users would choose two variables from “Average playtime”, “Ratio”, “Sales Volume”, “Price” and “Sales” and get the dot plot of them. From the plot, we find positive relationships between average playtime and sales volume, average playtime and sales. Ratio does not affect much on average playtime or sales. For AAA developers, even though they release some bad-rating games, people still buy them. That is one of the most important privileges of AAA companies: they have super fans and they tolerate the games of not-good-enough quality. Price does not affect much on sales volume. For AAA games, they would have normal sales with acceptable price. 6.3 Relationship of AAA and non-AAA We will then compare the evaluation criteria between AAA and Non-AAA games. 6.3.1 Ratio and Price As we said it before, ratio is the most objective standard. So we choose ratio as x-axis and the other factors as y-axis. We want to see the relationship between opinions of players and the other factors. We draw a dot plot to see the difference between AAA companies and others. AAA companies have even price distribution in the whole range, while the others tend to have lower price. Moreover, almost all the games of AAA companies have ratio over 0.5, while others distribute evenly in the whole range. A high price shows the confidence of its developer. We can see from that graph that Non-AAA companies are not willing to set a high price. It’s intuitive because high price will easily lead to a low sales volume. AAA companies have the confidence that high price won’t influence the sales while Non-AAA companies don’t want to take the risk. So Non-AAA companies tend to lower their price to attract more players. And it’s interesting that there are very few games with high price and low ratio. We guess that means developers have a clear knowledge of how good their games are. 6.3.2 Ratio and Sales We do more analysis with the sales with the good rating ratio, we can see the data points are stratified. The reason is that we generate random points using normal distribution from each range. What’s more, for the general trend, the game quantity is decreasing as the sales increase. If the game is AAA, they are clustered at greater sale than the game that is not AAA. There are few games that have high sales but low ratio. Many Non-AAA games have low ratio and low sales while AAA games don’t. It means even for low ratio AAA games they could have a relatively high sales because of the reputation. Games with the largest sales are AAA games. It’s no doubt because we pick AAA games by their sales. However, we can see that except a few best sales games, there are lots of good sales Non-AAA games which are better than most of the AAA games. The game market is not ruled by AAA companies. Non-AAA companies can make use of their advantages to compete with AAA companies. Thus, the healthy competition flourishes the market. 6.3.3 Ratio and Average time In this plot of ratio and average playtime between AAA companies and other companies. We find out that the log data have an approximate normal distribution. There is no big difference between AAA companies and others. The average playtime may be influenced by other factors, such as game type but not the ratio. And the distributions of average playtime with different ratios are similar. Different players have different preferences. As long as the games have their unique features, there will be players spending a lot of time on them. "],
["game-mode.html", "Chapter 7 Game Mode 7.1 Multi-player Games 7.2 Single-player Games", " Chapter 7 Game Mode 7.1 Multi-player Games Multiplayer games are the games that people can play with other players. Single-player-only games are games only for single players. To see the difference between multi-player games and single-player-only games, we can choose one variable and draw box plots to see the distribution. We can tell from the plots that multi-player games usually have slightly more playtime,less ratio, and they are more expensive. In sales volume and total sales, they do much better than single-player-only games. Coincidentally, these trends are the same in AAA games and Non-AAA games. Multiplayer games perform better in most variables, and AAA developers are more likely to develop them. In contrast, Non-AAA developers develop single-player-only games almost twice as many as multi-player games. Moreover, multiplayer games from AAA developers have higher quality than Non-AAA developers. That must be some other reasons, we guess Non-AAA developers could not devote much to maintain the servers of multi-player games. 7.2 Single-player Games Single games are the games that people can play alone. Multiplayer-only games are games only for multiple players. Multiplayer-only games don’t perform better than single games in playtime and ratio. But they have lower prices and sell much more than single games. AAA developers and other developers develop similar number of multiplayer-only games. It is a little weird that AAA developers don’t develop more multiplayer-only games since they sell well. Concerning the average playtime and ratio, we guess maybe players are more strict with multiplayer-only games. So AAA developers are cautious with the multiplayer-only games they release. If they are good enough, their reputation would be damaged by the negative ratings. "],
["game-tags.html", "Chapter 8 Game Tags 8.1 Type of AAA Games 8.2 Type of All Games 8.3 Popular Tags from 1998-2018 8.4 Worldcloud", " Chapter 8 Game Tags 8.1 Type of AAA Games In AAA games, the top 3 popular tags are Action, Strategy, FPS, which corresponds to the current game market trend. For example, GTA5, an action game developed 6 years ago, has the top 1 total sales and is still popular compared to others. Civilization VI and DOTA 2 are two excellent strategy games on the 2018 best seller top 10 list. Open world and Multiplayer tags are also popular for AAA games. As a result, AAA company will be more likely to put resource and cost to develop such games as they are profitable and attractive to players. 8.2 Type of All Games In Non-AAA games, the largest tag is indie, the small independent game without publisher and sponsor, since the majority of Non-AAA games are made by a small company, even by several people. Among the top 10 tags, the graph also includes the popular game tags for AAA games as the small game type will be affected by the large, famous and successful games. Another difference compared to AAA games tags is that the Casual tag is in 3rd place for Non-AAA games. Open world and Multiplayer tags have low number. These phenomena can be explained by the lack of capital and resources for developing for small companies. As a result, they will give up developing large scale games like Multiplayer and Open world to save cost and put more focus on small games such as casual because they are cheap and easy to develop. 8.3 Popular Tags from 1998-2018 From the graph above, AAA games have no great patterns as the time increasing since top 0.5% games number is too small, the pattern is not easy to find. For Non-AAA games, as the time increase, we can see the number of games designed is increasing rapidly, and the game with top trending game tags are increasing more rapidly. 8.4 Worldcloud "],
["conclusion.html", "Chapter 9 Conclusion 9.1 Brief summary 9.2 Limitations and Directions", " Chapter 9 Conclusion 9.1 Brief summary Based on the graph and analysis above, we can see that the major elements for AAA games to stand out all the games is the sales(price, value and volume), game mode(single/multiplayer and game tags)and player feedback(ratings and average play time). For the sales part, it’s obvious that AAA games have high sales as we pick the high sales games as AAA. AAA companies have very high sales value and sales volume, and the majority of AAA companies have design multiple of AAA games with excellence sales value and volume. However, there is an exception for PUBG cooperation, it only creates one game called PUBG while its sales far exceeds the other AAA companies’ total sum of sales. Compared to AAA games, Non AAA games tends to set to low price as the small companies are not confident about the quality of the game and are afraid of being defeated by large companies(AAA companies). For sales numbers, there are a small number of non AAA games have great sales. Therefore, different companies will have their own strategy to fit the game market situation. For content part, multiplayer tends to have greater sales and average play time than single player for AAA games. Action, Strategy and FPS are top 3 popular game tags for AAA games and they are the templates to create popular games for both large companies and small companies. For player feedback, AAA games will have more ratio of positive ratings and longer play time. Compare with AAA games, Non-AAA games will tend to have a mediocre positive ratings ratio and play time. 9.2 Limitations and Directions We don’t have access to the detail numbers of sales. The category data is not precise and our transformation cannot reveal the real number. We ease this issue by generating random number from each range by normal distribution. We can completely fix the issue if the data source make the data public. Popular games always have in-game purchase and that is their main method to make profits. In our analysis, we only consider the sales volume and total sales to evaluate them. We can make further analysis for the impact of in-game purchase with respect to sales, player feedback, etc. With the comparison of AAA companies, the data is not enough to tell us more about the companies. Actually, these are only the results of games, and cannot show the overall strength of AAA companies. In the future, we could find some other background data to work with, such as their developing history and their investment. "]
