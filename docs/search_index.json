Many students have played games on a PC platform Steam, including us. There are so many games and we may find it difficult to decide which game to play. Also, we have conflicts on defining which games are “good” and which are not. Maybe we cannot come to an agreement, but we are all interested in finding trends and patterns behind the popular games. Moreover, we would gain insights into what makes a game more successful in terms of sales, play-time and ratings, etc. We want to take a closer look at the data behind the games. But first, let us introduce some backgrounds for our data visualization. 1.1 Brief introduction Steam is the major gaming platform developed by Valve in PC which almost include all possible games on the PC. It was first launched as gaming improvement software in 2003 as a way for Valve to provide automatic updates for their games, and expanded to include games from third-party publishers. Steam has also expanded into an online web-based and mobile digital storefront. Steam offers digital rights management for protecting game copyrights, matchmaking servers for online multiplayer gaming, video streaming for recording and publishing game videos, and social networking services for connecting and exploring game social. It also provides the user with installation and automatic updating of games, and community features such as friends lists and groups, cloud saving, and in-game voice and chat functionality. For more detail information, please visit wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(service) 1.2 Criteria for judging a game We will use the definition of AAA games: It is a classification used for video games produced and distributed by major famous publisher(companies that having top 0.5% sales), typically having higher development and marketing budgets. We also call these types of companies as AAA company. AAA is analogous to the film industry term “blockbuster”. For more detail information, please visit wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAA_(video_game_industry) 1.3 Question What is the difference in sales between free games and charged games? Perform ranking of total sales for all companies, then take a closer look to companies at top rankings. What are the factors for influencing companies to produce good game? Does the multiplayer games or single-player games have an effect on game sale, or ‘AAA’ games What will the player‘s phenomenon and reaction for good game(avg play time, ratings, etc)? Does game price have an effect on game sales, ratings? What will be the difference between normal games and ‘AAA’ games Finally, we have our overall objective: what will be the key elements that effect on ‘AAA’ games? "],
["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Obstacles 2.2 Plan", " Chapter 2 Data sources Our data source is from: https://nik-davis.github.io/posts/2019/steam-data-collection/ Since the data above is already scratched from steam and cleaned to a sorted table, we download and read the csv file directly and then do the data cleaning once again based on our request for future use. First, the data is composed of a variety of information for each game on the Steam store. We make use of useful columns such as required_age, average and genres which we can eventually turn into features for analysis, and we use price_overview column to possibly inform the success and sales of each game. The owners column of the SteamSpy data could be useful for analyzing specifically. However, the name format for each company is slightly different that may not be accurate enough for doing general analysis. In the process of cleaning, we should integrate the name standard for all the company in dataset. We will use the positive and negative ratings or average play-time to create our metrics. There is also a tags column which appears to crossover with the categories and genres columns in the Steam data. We would like to merge these, or keep one over the other. 2.1 Obstacles There are too many tags for each game, many tags are too specified that is difficult to classify. The sales of a game in dataset only provide ranges (categories) with no specific numbers. the name format for each company is slightly different that may not be accurate enough for doing general analysis. 2.2 Plan Pick the tags with high frequency, and delete the other tags. We should integrate the name standard for all the company in dataset. Look for the raw data and try to get the specific sales, if not, we will use other methods to solve the issue. "],
["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Description 3.2 Before transformation 3.3 After transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Description Since the data has been pre-cleaned by the source, our transformation is: To deal with the sales variable, we convert the ranges (categories) into quantity by generating random numbers from the normal distribution in range. For each range, we set the medium number as the mean, standard deviation as the range/6. The main purpose of generating random number is to produce continuous data instead of categories data. For example, in range “0-20000”, we will replace value by generating number within mean = 10000, and standard deviation = 20000/6 (Since by the definition of area in normal distribution, 20000/6 will cover 99.7% of the total area in normal distribution) if the generated data is outside of 99.7% area in normal distribution, we will round them inside. Combine developers with their branch (For instance, “Ubisoft Montreal” is the Canandian branch of “Ubisoft”) and integrate the format of the same developer in different expressions. (For instance, “Astrofish Games” and “Astrofish Games Ltd” or “Astrofish Games Co, Ltd”) Group the data by platform, developer, etc. Filter the developers with the number of games they publish. 3.2 Before transformation First, we look at the graph as dimension of sales number and number of companies, from the graph above to find the pattern for games’ sales volume. We draw two vertical lines, sales volume of 10000 and 100000, as shrehold to identify the game. We can see that it’s approximately a right-skewed normal distribution. The largest bar is around 10000, which means many games have 10000 sales volume or below. Since our focus is primarily on games who are defined as ‘good’, which would be ‘AAA games’, therefore, we add a threshold at 10000(red line), and drop the game that sales volume is about 10000 and below, which means ’the games whose sales volume below 10000 have few quantities and hence is trivial for us to make further analysis. For our next step, we add another threshold line at 100000(blue line). Since there are too many games below 100000 and it is not in our consideration for AAA games. Therefore, we further narrow down our scope for analyzing top games. Concerning that sales of games would vary dramatically from the time they just have been released and become steady after a period of time, we drop the games released after 2019 since the result would be unstable. In another perspective of filtering, we mark the companies whose sales volume over 100000 as “large companies”. We define “ratio” as positive ratings over all ratings and “money” as sales volume multiplied by price. 3.3 After transformation Similar to the game volume plot, we filtered first that for the total game sales of companies that larger than 100000, narrowing down our analyze range. After we draw sales plot grouping by developers, it shows almost the same distribution: a right-skewed normal distribution. So, we add red shrehold line at 10000 and drop the developers whose sales below it for the same reason. "],

["aaa-games.html", "Chapter 5 AAA Games 5.1 Find AAA Games 5.2 AAA Game Companies 5.3 Games of AAA Companies", " Chapter 5 AAA Games 5.1 Find AAA Games First, we try to find AAA developers. We draw the Cleveland dot plots of their sales volume and sales. We draw vertical lines of 15,000,000 and 30,000,000 for sales volume, 150,000,000 and 300,000,000 for sales. 5.2 AAA Game Companies 5.2.1 Number of Games AAA developers are the top 0.05% companies. There are 31 companies in total. We pick them out and draw some plots. We reorder them by sales and show how many games they released. We are surprised that Pubg Corporation tops the sales but only has one game released. 5.2.2 Sales Volume In the sales plot of AAA companies, Valve surpasses Pubg. We claim that it’s because Valve has more low-price games or free games. We can examine it later by showing their free games. 5.2.3 Total Sales 5.3 Games of AAA Companies Shiny applications not supported in static R Markdown documents "],
["evaluation-factors.html", "Chapter 6 Evaluation Factors 6.1 Parallel Coordinates 6.2 Correlation of Different Variable 6.3 Relation of AAA and non-AAA", " Chapter 6 Evaluation Factors 6.1 Parallel Coordinates After the brief look and filtering, we draw the parallel coordinates to see the relationship between different game factors. With the interactivity, we can find some intuitive trends: Valve and Ubisoft have many free games, which corresponds to our claim above. Majority of game with low price have a large ratio of good ratings Almost all the games have large ratio, which accord with the claim that AAA games have large ratings High ratios will also have relatively high average playtime 6.2 Correlation of Different Variable Shiny applications not supported in static R Markdown documents 6.3 Relation of AAA and non-AAA 6.3.1 Ratio and Price We draw a dot plot to see the difference between AAA companies and others. AAA companies have even price distribution in the whole range, while the others tend to have lower price. Moreover, almost all the games of AAA companies have ratio over 0.5, while others distribute evenly in the whole range. 6.3.2 Ratio and Sales We do more analysis with the sales with the good rating ratio, we can see the data points are stratified. The reason is that we generate random points using normal distribution from each range. What’s more, for the general trend, the game quantity is decreasing as the sales increase. If the game is ‘AAA’, they are clustered at greater sale than the game that is not ‘AAA’. 6.3.3 Ratio and Average time ## Coordinate system already present. Adding new coordinate system, which will replace the existing one. In this plot of ratio and average playtime between AAA companies and other companies. We find out that the log data have an approximate normal distribution. There is no big difference between AAA companies and others. "],
["single-and-multi.html", "Chapter 7 Single and Multi 7.1 Multi or not 7.2 Single or not", " Chapter 7 Single and Multi 7.1 Multi or not Shiny applications not supported in static R Markdown documents We draw a dot plot of AAA company games considering whether the game can be played with other players, that is, whether it has the multi-game. Both of them have a more-sales-more-playtime trend. But, when we look at the high average playtime region, the points are mainly multi-games. It makes sense because people playing multi-games tend to spend more time for the cooperation and more engaged in the game. 7.2 Single or not Shiny applications not supported in static R Markdown documents The graph above shows the boxplot for single/multi player game with ‘AAA’ elements vs sales. Games that are ‘AAA’ (on the left) both have great sales than non ‘AAA’ games. And multi players game in general have larger sales than single players while game companies tend to make more single player game than multi-player game. The reason might be the low budget and few time cost for designing new single player games "],
