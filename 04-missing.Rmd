# Missing values

Since the data and is pre-cleaned before, all the data with missing values are dropped. Therefore, there are only a few missing values in our dataset. We will draw the table for missing data to further prove our conclusion.


```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
colSums(is.na(company_data)) %>% sort(decreasing = TRUE)
```
